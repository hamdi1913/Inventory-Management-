# Inventory-Management-
The Java-based inventory management system is a robust software solution designed to efficiently manage and track inventory in a business or organization. It provides separate interfaces for administrators and users, each with their own set of functionalities and permissions.

#Admin Functionality:

User Management: The administrator has the ability to create, modify, and delete user accounts. They can assign specific roles and permissions to each user, such as read-only access or full control over inventory data.
Product Management: The admin can add new products, update existing product details (e.g., name, description, price), and remove discontinued or out-of-stock items.
Inventory Tracking: The administrator can monitor the stock levels of each product, view detailed information about quantities and locations, and generate reports on inventory status.

#User Functionality:

Product Search: Users can search for products based on various criteria, such as name, category, or SKU (stock keeping unit).
Inventory Availability: Users can check the availability of products in real-time and view information like current stock levels and locations.
Order Placement: Users can place orders for products, specify quantities, and provide shipping details.
Order Tracking: Users can track the status of their orders, view estimated delivery dates, and receive notifications about shipment updates.

The system incorporates various Java technologies and frameworks, such as Java SE (Standard Edition), JavaFX or Swing for the user interface, and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database interactions. It leverages object-oriented programming principles to ensure modularity, extensibility, and code reusability.
